## Syntax

We'll actually be learning the syntax as we go, so for now just keep this in mind.

You have "expressions."

Your program is made of one or more expressions separated by ";".

```nano
<expression>; <expression>
```

You can omit the ";" if you break a line.

```nano
<expression>
<expression>
```

But what can expressions be made of???

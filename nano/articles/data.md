A value is the first conceptual building block of your running program. Values are an abstraction of memory which is being moved and manipulated by your program.

nano provides syntax for describing values of various data formats.

```nano
# booleans
true
false

# integers
40
0xAF
-9
350

# floats
4.0
0.1

# strings
"Hello, world!"

```

There are many ways of creating values, so we'll learn about them as we go.

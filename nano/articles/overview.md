## The nano programming language

### What is nano?

nano is a programming language that aims to explore the essence of writing code, and how language features can empower or hinder a programmer's ability to write code effectively.

```nano
# main.nn
from standard import { print }

@entry fn main -> print "Hello, world!"
```

### But why though?

Turing-complete systems are exchangeable, and the world has had a lot of them. So why does the world need another programming language?

It doesn't.

But I'm doing it anyways. This is my exploration into this topic, and I've learned so much since I started. I'm pretty proud of what I came up with. My choices (which were always going to be biased) revealed a lot about what I think of coding, and every new iteration of this project is how I gauge my computer science experience now.

### Can I learn nano?

nano has a few concepts, which are designed to be consistent and powerful. It should take about a weekend to learn idiomatic nano if you have good previous computer science knowledge.

### Does nano have a compiler?

Not yet. See: [https://github.com/mrpedrobraga/nnc]().

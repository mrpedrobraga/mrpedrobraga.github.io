The kids are depressed and have no self esteem because outside sucks.
We need to start creating more public, free spaces for people to exercize.
Once they're in connection with the sun and their own bodies they'll finally heal.

You can also have self-esteem by accepting your body as it is,
and not feel pressured to change it so people will like it.

...aaaaand there we go. Twitter, everybody!
Maybe if you were outside exercizing you wouldn't have time to be offended?
Or maybe you are afraid of learning that exercizing can actually help improve your life?

Zoey  @fuckunicorns

I'd love to learn more about exercizing, but as I have a PhD in Exercise Science
I can't find many places to look at.

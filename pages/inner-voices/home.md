\* Greetings.

\* My dear, dear stranger...

\* You haven't heard of me. And I don't know you...

\* And yet here you are.

<hr class="short">

\* "Inner Voices."

---

\* This game... This game between you and I...

\* It consumes my every thought. It pounds on my chest from within, urging to be unleashed.

\* Yearning to be real.

\* The circumstances... make it hard.

\* It's been harder and harder to stay awake. To keep that light shining.

\* And it's been glowing dimmer and dimmer for a while.

\* And my dream projects further and further away.

\* But, stranger... I don't think I can give up.

---

\* I tried.

---

\* Sometimes I wish I could. But I _can't_.

---

\* I can't promise to make you happy.

\* I can't promise to make you sad.

\* I can't promise you anything anymore.

\* But...

\* If you can find it within your heart...

---

\* Promise me you'll come back?

\* To read again at these same old words.

\* Peek around the same empty pages.

\* Maybe one day, I'll have something better waiting for you.

\* My dream.

\* And we won't be strangers anymore.

---

---

\* And if these words never change...

---

---

\* I'm sorry.

---

---

\* I'm sorry.

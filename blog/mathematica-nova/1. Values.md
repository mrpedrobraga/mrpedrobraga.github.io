The first foundational concept in mathematics is the Value.

Explaining what a value is is quite tricky, and not because it is complicated! You see, a value merely _is_. There is nothing else to it. A value does not inherently _do anything_, really.

And that is it! You have learned what a value is!

ðŸŽ‰

Alright, by now it should be very clear to you what I mean by "from the very beginning." You should also be rather unsatisfied since there are no moving parts to play with.

While values as an idea does not give us any interesting toys, they do play a central role in mathematics. For the purpose of demonstration, I will create our first value for us to explore.

So... there we go. I made a new value. I'm... thinking of it.

Hmm...

Well, this won't do, right? You see, since values aren't anything, I don't have something to show you. Luckily, the concept from the next chapter will solve this conundrum!

That's right, to the next chapter!

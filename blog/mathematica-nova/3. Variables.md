It's possible to have a name that is not bound to any particular value. This unbound name is called a "variable," in the sense that it "varies": if we have a name $a$, we can enumerate which values it might refer to.

For now, let's only consider ▽ and ▲[^1].

| $a$ |
| --- |
| ▽   |
| ▲   |
The opposite of a variable (a bound name) is called a "constant."

> [!TIP] Variable (noun)
> A name that does not represent a value in specific.

> [!TIP] Constant (noun)
> A name that _does_ represent a value in specific.

[^1]: In this case, $a$ really can refer to any value, even values that aren't these ones. The idea of restricting a value to only be able to refer to specific values is something interesting that we will formalise later.

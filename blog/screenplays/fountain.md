title: Writing Screenplays for Games
description: Introduction to Fountain
---

As you might very well know, I have a video game project of mine called **Inner Voices**, a story-driven role-playing game.

When it comes to deciding what will happen on the game and sharing that vision with other people, it's necessary to write story _scripts_.

```fountain
INT. CLAIRE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CLAIRE holds a candle gently.

CLAIRE
It's so dark in here...

BRUNO
I know, right?

Bruno brings out his phone and attempts to light the room with its screen's backlight.

BRUNO (CONT'D)
(cowardly)
Is it just me or is this more sinister than last time?

CUT TO:

EXT. NEW HORIZON - CONTINUOUS

The two of them step outside. There is no moonlight, nor any lamp post lights â€” everything is unnaturally pitch black.

BRUNO
Yeah...

CLAIRE ^
Yeah...

Bruno grasps for Claire in the darkness.

BRUNO
Not liking the reality bending aspect of this.

~Come to me, come to me, child of the dark...

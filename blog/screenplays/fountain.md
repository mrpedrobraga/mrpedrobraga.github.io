title: Writing Screenplays for Games
description: Introduction to Fountain
---

As you might very well know, I have a video game project of mine called **Inner Voices**, a story-driven role-playing game.

When it comes to deciding what will happen on the game and sharing that vision with other people, it's necessary to write story _scripts_.

```fountain
INT. CLAIRE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CLAIRE holds a candle gently.

THE CAMERA PANS FROM THE BOTTOM REVEALING HER CANDLE-LIT FACE.

CLAIRE
It's so dark in here...

BRUNO
I know, right?

Bruno brings out his phone and attempts to light the room with its screen's backlight.

BRUNO (CONT'D)
Is it just me or is this more sinister than last time?
